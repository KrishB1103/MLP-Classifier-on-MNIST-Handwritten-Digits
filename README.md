# MLP-Classifier-on-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits
This repository contains a simple yet effective implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built from scratch using PyTorch and serves as a foundational example of fully connected feedforward neural networks.
